= SPEC-001: AI-Powered Product Optimization and Completion Tool for Shopware
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

E-commerce platforms face challenges in maintaining high-quality and complete product listings. Suboptimal titles, descriptions, pricing inconsistencies, and missing product metadata often lead to poor customer experiences and reduced sales. 

Shopware, a robust open-source e-commerce platform, provides APIs that facilitate product management and data retrieval. Leveraging these APIs, this project aims to integrate AI capabilities to optimize product listings and assist merchants by auto-completing missing data fields, thereby improving efficiency and enhancing the shopping experience.

This tool will cater to merchants who use Shopware, enabling them to streamline operations, improve product discoverability, and make data-driven decisions through AI-powered suggestions.

== Requirements

This section outlines the requirements for building the AI-powered product optimization and completion tool, categorized using the MoSCoW framework:

=== Must-Have
- Integrate with the Shopware API for retrieving and updating product data.
- AI-powered product optimization:
  ** Suggest improvements for product titles, descriptions, and tags.
  ** Auto-generate missing product details such as descriptions or specifications.
- Product data completion:
  ** Detect and fill missing fields (e.g., images, categories, keywords).
  ** Validate data consistency across product listings.
- Dashboard for merchants to view, edit, and approve AI suggestions.
- User authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for merchants.
- Secondary database (PostgreSQL) to store enriched product data and track changes.

=== Should-Have
- AI-driven price recommendations based on historical sales and market trends.
- Batch processing for optimizing multiple products simultaneously.
- Integration with third-party analytics tools for additional insights.

=== Could-Have
- Real-time notifications for merchants about optimization opportunities.
- Support for multiple languages in AI-generated content.
- Export enriched product data in CSV or JSON formats.

=== Wonâ€™t-Have
- Direct integration with payment or shipping systems (not relevant to optimization).
- Offline functionality, as the tool heavily depends on the Shopware API and cloud resources.

== Method

The AI-powered product optimization and completion tool will use a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The key components include the frontend, backend, AI engine, and integration with the Shopware API.

=== AI Approach

The AI component will perform two main tasks:

1. **Product Optimization**:
   - Use a pre-trained language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT or equivalent) fine-tuned for e-commerce content to suggest better product titles, descriptions, and tags.
   - Validate keywords based on search trends or user-specified priorities.

2. **Product Completion**:
   - Detect missing fields (e.g., images, categories, specifications) using a rule-based system.
   - Use AI to auto-generate missing data (e.g., generate descriptions based on existing metadata).

=== Data Flow

1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Fetch product data from the Shopware API, including metadata, titles, descriptions, and pricing.
2. **Data Processing**:
   - AI engine analyzes the product data and identifies fields for improvement or completion.
3. **Data Presentation**:
   - Processed data and AI suggestions are displayed on the merchant dashboard.
4. **Data Update**:
   - Upon approval, updated data is sent back to the Shopware API and logged in the PostgreSQL database.

=== Database Schema

A PostgreSQL database will track enriched data and activity logs. Sample schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    shopware_id INT NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    tags TEXT[],
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    category TEXT,
    images JSONB,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE activity_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT REFERENCES products(id),
    action TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id INT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

=== AI Model Integration

- Input: JSON object containing product data (title, description, tags, etc.).
- Processing: AI generates content using pre-trained models fine-tuned for e-commerce data.
- Output: AI-enhanced product data, including new or updated fields.

Example Input:
```json
{
    "title": "Wireless Earbuds",
    "description": "",
    "tags": ["audio", "electronics"],
    "price": 49.99,
    "category": "Accessories"
}
```
Example Output:
```json
{
    "title": "Premium Wireless Earbuds",
    "description": "Experience high-quality sound with our premium wireless earbuds. Perfect for music lovers on the go.",
    "tags": ["audio", "electronics", "wireless"],
    "price": 49.99,
    "category": "Accessories"
}
```
